# Workday-Scheduler
This is my homework submission for an assignment where I had to create a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The proper date and time being displayed at the top of the application was accomplished using Moment.js.
